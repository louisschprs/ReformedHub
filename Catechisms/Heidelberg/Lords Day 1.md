## Lord’s Day 1

### Q & A 1

**Q. What is your only comfort in life and in death?**

**A.** That I am not my own,^[1 Cor. 6:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6:19-20&version=ESV) but belong—

body and soul, in life and in death—^[Rom. 14:7-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14:7-9&version=ESV)

to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.^[1 Cor. 3:23; Titus 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3:23%3B+Titus+2:14&version=ESV)

He has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood,^[1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 John 1:7-9; 2:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1:18-19%3B+1+John+1:7-9%3B+2:2&version=ESV) and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil.^[John 8:34-36; Heb. 2:14-15; 1 John 3:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8:34-36%3B+Hebrews+2:14-15%3B+1+John+3:1-11&version=ESV) He also watches over me in such a way^[John 6:39-40; 10:27-30; 2 Thess. 3:3; 1 Pet. 1:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6:39-40%3B+10:27-30%3B+2+Thessalonians+3:3%3B+1+Peter+1:5&version=ESV) that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven;^[Matt. 10:29-31; Luke 21:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10:29-31%3B+Luke+21:16-18&version=ESV) in fact, all things must work together for my salvation.^[Rom. 8:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8:28&version=ESV)

Because I belong to him, Christ, by his Holy Spirit, assures me of eternal life^[Rom. 8:15-16; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 5:5; Eph. 1:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8:15-16%3B+2+Corinthians+1:21-22%3B+5:5%3B+Ephesians+1:13-14&version=ESV) and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him.^[Rom. 8:1-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8:1-17&version=ESV)

### Q & A 2

**Q. What must you know to live and die in the joy of this comfort?**

**A.** Three things:

first, how great my sin and misery are;^[Rom. 3:9-10; 1 John 1:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3:9-10%3B+1+John+1:10&version=ESV) second, how I am set free from all my sins and misery;^[John 17:3; Acts 4:12; 10:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17:3%3B+Acts+4:12%3B+10:43&version=ESV) third, how I am to thank God for such deliverance.^[Matt. 5:16; Rom. 6:13; Eph. 5:8-10; 2 Tim. 2:15; 1 Pet. 2:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:16%3B+Romans+6:13%3B+Ephesians+5:8-10%3B+2+Timothy+2:15%3B+1+Peter+2:9-10&version=ESV)
